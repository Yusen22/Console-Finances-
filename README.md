# Console Finance Calculator


## Description

This project is for a console-based financial analysis application that is written in Javascript. The application uses a data set in the form "'MMM-YYYY', PROFIT(num)" to calculate total months analysed, net total profit over that period, average change in profits over that period, and the greatest increase and decrease in profits shown in the data month-to-month.

The data provided with the application is not exhaustive, and can be subject to an increase or decrease in the number of data points present whilst the application's functionality is maintained. This would require elements to be added to the 'finances' array in Javascript.
